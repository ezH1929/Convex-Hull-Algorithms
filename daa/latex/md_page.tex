Jarvis March, also known as the Gift Wrapping algorithm, is used to find the convex hull of a given set of points in a plane. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the points in the set.

Here\textquotesingle{}s how the Jarvis March algorithm works\+:

Initialization\+: Start by selecting the point with the lowest x-\/coordinate. This point is guaranteed to be on the convex hull. If there are multiple points with the same lowest x-\/coordinate, choose the one with the lowest y-\/coordinate.

Finding the Next Point on the Hull\+: From the current point, consider all other points and find the one that has the smallest counterclockwise angle with respect to the current point. This can be done by comparing the slopes of lines formed by joining the current point with each of the other points.

Updating the Current Point\+: Move to the point identified in step 2. This point is now part of the convex hull.

Termination\+: Continue this process until you reach the starting point again. This indicates that the convex hull has been completed.

Output\+: Return the list of points that form the convex hull.

Here\textquotesingle{}s the Jarvis March algorithm written in pseudocode with points


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Initialize an empty list to store points on the convex hull.
\item Find the point with the lowest x-\/coordinate (or lowest y-\/coordinate if there are ties) and assign it as the starting point.
\item Set the current point as the starting point.
\item Repeat the following steps\+: a. Add the current point to the convex hull list. b. Initialize the next point as null. c. For each point in the input set\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the next point is null or the current point is on the left side of the line formed by the current and next points\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Update the next point to the current point. d. Update the current point to the next point found. e. Continue this process until the current point becomes the starting point again.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Return the list of points representing the convex hull.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The Jarvis March algorithm has a time complexity of O(nh), where n is the number of input points and h is the number of points on the convex hull. In the worst case, when all points are on the convex hull, the time complexity becomes O(n\texorpdfstring{$^\wedge$}{\string^}2). However, in practical scenarios, it performs efficiently for moderate-\/sized input sets.
